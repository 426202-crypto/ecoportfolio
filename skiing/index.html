	  Someone important to me: 
<ul> My dad taught me how to ski, he was an extreme skier before I was born and was excited to take me up the mountain and teach me.
	I always enjoyed having time with him and hearing about stories about when he was young and learning to ski. It was a special time to spend swith family and have a good time. 
Now that I am older and we can ski more extreme things, we have a dream to go helicopter skiing. </ul>
